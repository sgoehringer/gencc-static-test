# GenCC Members
The GenCC organizations maintain resources that provide information pertaining to the validity of gene-disease relationships or curate this information as clinical testing laboratories.

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Gene Validity Term Delphi Survey
To harmonize terms describing gene-disease validity, the GenCC used a Delphi method to survey both members of our GenCC organizations and the international genetics community.

- A short introductory video describing the survey can be [found here](https://vimeo.com/306463165)

Terms that were agreed upon are "Definitive, Strong, Moderate, Limited, Disputed Evidence, Refuted Evidence, Animal Model Only, and No Known Disease Relationship".

- Read about our results in the ACMG abstract and the slides presented at CCG 2019.

All member groups will now use or map to relevant harmonized terms in their curation work.
